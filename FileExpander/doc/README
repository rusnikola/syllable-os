IMPORTANT!
If you are still using Launcher/LBrowser please take in mind to remove "/system/bin/FileBrowser"
symbolic link before the Dock package installing (if you are planning to do it).
Don't forget to reinstall FileExpander after it to register file types associated with FileExpander :)

1. Using MIME types
If you want to assign MIME type manually please type:
  addattrib <file> os::MimeType <type>
for example: addattrib test.zip os::MimeType "application/x-zip"
Also you can install Dock & registrar package to make your work with file types more easily ;)

2. ftreg program
This program is developed to register file types during FileExpander installation.
In fact ftreg is very simple program and not very useful.
But it can help you if you want to create FileExpander "add-on" package (package that
allows FileExpander to work with another archive formats) to register new file type properly.

3. How to add new unpacker
Please edit "/etc/FileExpander.rules" file.
%s is source path; please make sure that you have only one %s in your rule!

4. How to unpack zip files
Please install "AFS unzip" package. You can found it at Kamidake software catalog.
