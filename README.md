# Applications for Syllable OS

This repository contains applications that I have developed just for fun
for [Syllable OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_Desktop) (which is now defunct) long time ago.

Those are here for nostalgic reasons mostly. However, due to API similarity,
some may find this code useful for [Haiku OS](https://www.haiku-os.org/) which
is in active development currently. For this reason, I additionally added the
MIT license option for FileExpander and AttribEdit (see below).

## License (FileExpander and AttribEdit)

Both FileExpander and AttribEdit source files were originally licensed
under GPLv2+. I also add another, more liberal license (MIT) as an option
for almost all source files for these programs (except non-essential library
files that contained other authors and cannot be distributed under different
terms).

## FileExpander

The GUI tool which is a frontend for command-line archivers. Any archiver can
be configured potentially. Initially, I was just trying to be similar to
BeOS's Expander but later extended the tool to support encrypted files, etc.

## AttribEdit

Extended file attributes (GUI) editor.

## Keyboard

Keyboard preferences which allows to select and use multiple languages. Can
only be distributed under the original GPLv2+ license since it was derived
from the out-of-box (simpler) Keyboard program and contained other authors.
