WHAT IT IS
----------
This program is developed especially for users that should use more than one keymap.
Of course it's not real keymap switcher, but can help you if you have two keymaps in use.
This program generates special hidden file ".dual-keymap" for this purpose.

1. CapsLock should be used for switching between languages.
2. Switching to upper case letters will be available for both languages by using Shift key.

HOW TO USE
---------
1. Normal mode (only one keymap in use, CaspLock works as usual)

	Check box "Use alternate keymap" should be turned off.
	Set prefer keymap as primary keymap.

2. Dual-keymap mode (two keymaps in use, CapsLock works as switcher between langauges)

	Check box "Use alternate keymap" should be turned on.
	Set primary and alternate keymaps.

INSTALL
-------
Just type ./install.sh and enjoy it :)
